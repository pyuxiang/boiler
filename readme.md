# Boilerplate library

Pain point: Repetitive coding of the same functionality, which often involves doing the same Google searches.
Really a list of recipes for consolidation.

Some workflows:

Run tests:

```
python -m pytest
```

Install library:

```
pip install -e .
```

Uninstall library:

```
python setup.py develop -u
```
